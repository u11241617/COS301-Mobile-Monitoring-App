	The files necessary to be installed on the server so that iCrawler can run can be retrieved from The 5 Concurrent Node Git-hub repository. The iCrawler 	application sends all its data/logs to a dashboard that is a xhtml website. The file necessary to run the dashboard can be downloaded from The 5 Concurrent Node Git-hub repository. The files need only be copy pasted onto the server. On access of the dashboard the user will be presented with a 			login page where the user will have to be registered on the iCrawler mobile application first before being able to login on the dashboard.\newpage

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Does not launch.} Restart your phone and try to launch the application again.
		\item\textbf{Crashes immediately after launch.} Ensure that your device meets the minimum specifications to run
		 iCrawler (See configurations). Go to Settings $\rightarrow$ Apps $\rightarrow$ Manage Apps $\rightarrow$ Running, to check if your apps are not using up all
		  your memory. Try to end all processes you do not need and re-start your phone.
		\item \textbf{Other unknown causes.} If problems continue, delete the app completely and then reinstall it from Google Play Store.\
	\end{itemize}
