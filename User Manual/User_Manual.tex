	\section{Overview}
	\emph{You have a 13 year old child whom in the past years excelled at school in academics and sports activities. Suddenly, out of the blue, you start noticing a change in his behavior; his/her grades are dropping, he/she spends more time alone and doesnâ€™t enjoy doing the things he/she use to do. This can be really stressful and saddening for any parent/guardian; even worse, when the child is not talking to you...}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Does not launch.} Restart your phone and try to launch the application again.
		\item\textbf{Crashes immediately after launch.} Ensure that your device meets the minimum specifications to run
		 iCrawler (See configurations). Go to Settings $\rightarrow$ Apps $\rightarrow$ Manage Apps $\rightarrow$ Running, to check if your apps are not using up all
		  your memory. Try to end all processes you do not need and re-start your phone.
