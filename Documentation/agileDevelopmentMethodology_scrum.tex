	\section{Overview}
	This document is intended to serve as a reference for the development methodology used for the Mobile Monitoring App; which was proposed 
	by Emilio Mumba for COS301 final year project.\newline\newline
	The app is intended to promote readiness in digital forensics, protect users from malicious entities and activities, and provide proactive 
	measures that are undertaking by the mobile device user/owner. It monitors user activities and collects data/logs from the device. The data
	is then reported to a desktop computer which generates reports that give the investigator a good starting point in his/her investigation.\newpage
